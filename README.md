First bricks of a realtime chat application built with Svelte, TypeScript, Vite and PocketBase.

## To start this project
1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Download the PocketBase executable [here](https://pocketbase.io/docs/), rename the folder `pocketbase` (or as you like) and move it either inside this project or wherever you prefer.
4. Launch the DB server: `cd` in the `pocketbase` (or how ever you called it) folder and run `./pocketbase serve`
5. Launch the front-end: open a new terminal window and run `npm run dev`
6. Continue building this thing: add styles, tests & all the things!
